## Inspiration
Imagine a world without a teacher, doctor, a nurse, an entrepreneur, developer, caregiver, researcher, a handyman etc., now just imagine a world without all this, imagine a world of clueless illiterates faced with life's challenges. Would humanity survive? It is only possible to have all these profession offering their services and solving real lif problems because of their education (all/any form of learning and transfer of knowledge) and even so, we're short of them and we need more of them... The importance of educating the world cannot be overemphasized and we can only do that by ensuring everyone is opportune to get at least the necessary basic education for them to successfully maximize their passion to whatever level they desire, we can only do that by ensuring the funds and resources they will need to achieve this are made available for them.
